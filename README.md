A listing of my python programs to gain familiarity with syntax.

### Sorting Algorithms
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
|[Bubble Sort   ](https://github.com/Julellisg/Python-Programs/blob/main/bubblesort.py)|Repeatedly steps through a list of items to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.|
|[Selection Sort](https://github.com/Julellisg/Python-Programs/blob/main/selectionsort.py)|Repeatedly selects the smallest element from an unsorted portion of a list and places it at the beginning of the list.|
|[Insertion Sort](https://github.com/Julellisg/Python-Programs/blob/main/insertionsort.py)|Builds the final sorted array one item at a time|
|[Merge Sort](https://github.com/Julellisg/Python-Programs/blob/main/mergesort.py)|Recursive sorting algorithm that divides the input array into smaller arrays, sorts them separately, and then merges them back into a final sorted array|
